# SenshiOkami
Senshi Okami, a 3D fighting game created with Unity, showcases dynamic combat, diverse characters, and arenas. It features advanced mechanics like red casting and real-time event sync for smooth multiplayer. Developed with C#, it enhanced my skills in 3D game development, event handling, and data synchronization.
